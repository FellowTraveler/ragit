rag-cat-file(1)
==========

NAME
----
rag-cat-file - Show content of a file or a chunk

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag cat-file' <uid>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command dump the contents of a file or a chunk.

It doesn't always dump the exact content of the file, and that's intentional.
Some file readers modify the file content when chunking in order to give more
context to LLMs. `cat-file` works by merging chunks and it's not smart enough
to re-construct the original file.
