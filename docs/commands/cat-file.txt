rag-cat-file(1)
==========

NAME
----
rag-cat-file - Show content of a file or a chunk

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag cat-file' <uid>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command dump the contents of a file or a chunk.

It doesn't always dump the exact content of the file, and that's intentional.
For example, the default csv reader prepends csv header to each chunk in order
to give more context to LLMs. `cat-file` works by merging chunks and it's not
smart enough to remove the redundant lines.
