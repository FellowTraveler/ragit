rag-ls-images(1)
==========

NAME
----
rag-ls-images - Show information about images

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag ls-images' [--stat-only | --uid-only] [<uid>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run `rag help uid-query` to read how uid-query works. If the uid is not of
an image, it dies.

If it's ambiguous (e.g. prefix is short and matches multiple images), it shows the
information about all the matched images. I don't like this behavior and is likely to
change later.
