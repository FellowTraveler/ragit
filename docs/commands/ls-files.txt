NAME
----
rag-ls-files - Show information about files

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag ls-files' [--name-only | --stat-only | --uid-only] [<uid>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run `rag help uid-query` to read how uid-query works. If the uid is of a chunk
or an image, it dies.

If multiple files are matched, it shows the information about all the matched files.
This behavior may change later. It would allow matching multiple files if the query
is path-prefix-matching (though it's not implemented yet), but not if it's uid-matching.
