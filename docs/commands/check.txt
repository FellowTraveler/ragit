DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command checks whether a knowledge-base is corrupted or not. There are 2 use
cases for this command. It's quite expensive command to run.

1. When you have downloaded a knowledge-base and wanna know whether the knowledge-base
   is corrupted or not, run this command.
2. If you have implemented a new feature, which modifies a knowledge-base, use this
   command to check whether your new feature does something bad or not. If you're
   writing a test for your feature, this command will help you a lot.

It comes with 2 options: `--recursive` and `--recover`.

`--recursive` runs `rag check` on all its external bases, and their external bases.
`--recover` tries to recover from a corrupted knowledge-base, without any loss of
information. It may fail.
