NAME
----
rag-build - Build knowledge-base from staged files

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag build' [--dashboard]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run `rag help chunks` to read documents on chunks and files.

This command reads files in the staging area and process them. Once it's processed, you can ask queries on them.
You can interrupt a building at anytime. When interrupted, processed files so far are kept safely, but
"curr_processing_file" and its chunks will be discarded.
