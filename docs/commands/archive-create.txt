NAME
----
rag-archive-create - Create an archive of a knowledge-base

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag archive-create' [--jobs <n=4>] [--size-limit <n=0>] --output <file> [--[no-]configs] [--[no-]prompts] [--force]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
You can create an archive of a knowledge-base. You can easily store and share your knowledge-base.
`rag pull` and `rag clone` also send and receive archive files.

If `--size-limit` is 0 or not set, it creates a single file. If the limit is set, it tries
its best to keep each file smaller than `n` bytes.

By default, the archives do not include configs and prompts. If you extract such archives, the
knowledge-bases will have default configs and default prompts. You can override this behavior
with `--configs` and `--prompts` option.

By default, it raises an error if the output file already exists. You can forcefully
write to the file with `--force` option. If something goes wrong while forcefully writing
to a file, you might lose the original data. Be careful.

The created archive does not include inverted index. You have to run `ii-build` after you
extract the archive.
