NAME
----
rag-clone - Clone a knowledge-base into a new directory

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag clone' <remote url> [<directory>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Like `git clone`, it clones a knowledge-base and copies it to a newly created directory.

`rag clone` is for cloning query-only knowledge-bases. You cannot clone a half-built knowledge-base
and continue building it.
