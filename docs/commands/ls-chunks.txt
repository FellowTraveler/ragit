NAME
----
rag-ls-chunks - Show information about chunks

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rag ls-chunks' [--uid-only | --stat-only] [--json] [<uid>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run `rag help uid-query` to read how uid-query works. If the uid is of a chunk,
if shows the information about the chunk. If it's a file, it shows the information
about the chunks of the file. If it's an image, it dies.

If it's ambiguous (e.g. prefix is short and matches multiple chunks), it shows the
information about all the matched chunks. I don't like this behavior and is likely to
change later.

If `--json` is set, it dumps a valid json to stdout. Its schema is,

- no flags: [chunk: object]
- `--uid-only`: [uid: string]
- `--stat-only`: { "chunks": integer }
