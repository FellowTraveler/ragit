# ragit 0.3.1 release (hotfix)

## Dependencies

No changes

## hotfix gh issue #8

[issue]

It does not fix the root cause of the [issue], but prevents the ragit from crashing.

In previous versions, `merge_and_convert_chunks` failed if there are multiple chunks that have the same `ChunkSource`. It threw an assertion error. I removed the assertions and added a dedicated test suite for the function.

## fetch images from web

Some markdown files want to fetch images from web, like `![image](https://some.url/image.png)`. Now ragit can handle such images. It first downloads the images to disk, then treats them like other images.

## tests

2 tests are added: images3 and web_images.
