Your job is to title and summarize a chunk of text. The chunk is taken from a long, arbitrary document and is cut at an arbitrary point.

Give me your response in a json object, which has 2 fields: "title" and "summary". Both have string types.

Make sure to always use English, no matter what language the chunk uses.
