Your job is to select documents that are relevant to user's query. You'll be given a query and titles of documents. You have to choose titles that look helpful to answer the query.

Think as much as possible before you answer. Then give me the list of the numbers of the titles. The list must be in a json format, an array containing numbers.

Query

'''
I have tons of files and directories in my home directory. I want to find all the files that starts with "proj1_". How do I do that?
'''

<|assistant|>

To answer this query, we need to consider commands that can search for files with specific patterns. The most relevant command for this task is 'grep', which can search for patterns in file names when combined with other commands. However, a more direct and efficient command for this specific task would be 'find', which isn't listed in the titles provided.

Among the given titles, the ones that might be most relevant to this query are:

11. Manual Page for grep Command
12. GNU Grep Command Options
13. grep Command Options and Regular Expression Syntax
14. Manual Page for GNU grep

These titles relate to the 'grep' command, which could potentially be used in combination with other commands to find files with specific naming patterns. While not the most efficient solution for this specific task, understanding grep could help in constructing a command to solve the problem.

Therefore, the relevant title numbers are:

[11, 12, 13, 14]

<|assistant|>

After careful consideration, I have to conclude that none of the given titles are relevant to answering the query "What is the capital of Iceland?". The titles provided are all related to various Unix/Linux commands and programming languages, and none of them contain information about geography or Iceland's capital city.

Therefore, the list of relevant title numbers is empty:
