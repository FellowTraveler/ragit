# ragit-server

This is a bare-minimum, proof-of-concept implementation of ragit-server.

I spend 99% of time writing ragit, and less than 1% writing ragit-server. If you want a production-level server, you should write your own on top of ragit. Make sure to implement all the api endpoints that this server implements.
